- 👋 Hi, I’m @dcpr1ce, I'm new here and code on and off both in my uni studies and in my own time.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming to support mechanical and electrical engineering work, mainly data processing/modelling tools, productivity tools and microcontroller code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mainly Python and Matlab, but I like to branch out into other languages and have tried Arduino/C++, C# and Fortran for individual projects in the past, all of which I intend to come back to from time to time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate at some point in the future, but I'm just getting started for now so I would prefer to learn the basics without getting in anyone's way at the moment.
- 📫 Once I get to that point and am ready to start collaborating, I'll update this Readme, feel free to reach out after that.
